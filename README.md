> The syntax in your slides for the implementation of a nav bar was a little misleading, especially when this is my first time using bootstrap and designing a mobile-first website. Links to clearer guides about using bootstrap might be helpful resources to understand what I'm actually accomplishing with each syntax. Things like the container class implementation and the media implementation in css took me a while to understand.
